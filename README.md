Software Defined Radios based on funcube pro plus, gnuradio and raspberry pi

The files here helps to start quickly with a funcube dongle to receive local broadcast fm staions for testing purposes using gnuradio. Although the device is not meant for wide band fm reception, it still can be used with some distortion (observed with certain stations). The files are mainly aimed at beginners of gnuradio and funcube.

If you dont have the hardware, there is an example capture file which can be tested without any funcube dongle. Open the grc files in your gnuradio companion and may have to change the file path (it currently shows mine, so replace it with yours and click on the run button)
